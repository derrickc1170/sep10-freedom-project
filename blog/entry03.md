<h1>Topic Cooking</h1>
In this Entry, I am finalizing my SEP10 Freedom Project Content which I can make website about how I can improve cooking technologies in order to help the world.

## Part B A New Era of Technology
## Help For Food Waste
I came up a item for people who was poor and need of nutritious.So I make New Cooking Technologies called ¨Recombinator¨.
The Recombinator is a device that can recombine basic ingredients or molecules. It can customize food based on taste or nutritional needs, offering sustainable and waste-free solutions for feeding populations, especially in challenging environments like space.
## Using For Vacation 
What if you were stuck in middle of nowhere,lazy to cooking anything,or too poor to get food.? Introducing ¨Printer Cooking Station¨!!
Printer Cooking Station is cutting-edge device that uses 3D printing to simplify and customize meal preparation. It automates tasks like measuring, assembling, and presenting dishes, offering endless possibilities for creative and efficient cooking
## Fast Shopping
Want any item that appear to you without wait for shipping? Digital Item Website allows users to spawn purchased items into compatible devices or applications, making digital content instantly accessible. With a user-friendly interface and secure transactions, it offers a seamless experience for exploring, acquiring, and utilizing digital content. 
## Need Cut
Any thing need help to be cut? Well, I ofter a solution for you "The Auto Cutter". The Auto Cutter is a versatile, automatic tool that cuts anything from soft fruits to tough meats. It offers customizable cut sizes and shapes, and works with any available power source, ensuring flexibility and efficiency for various applications.
## Engineering Design Process
I’m currently finalizing all the content for the website as part of my engineering design process. This involves refining text, optimizing images, and ensuring a user-friendly layout to enhance the overall user experience and functionality.

## Skill 
#### Googling 
Googling saves time by providing instant access to information through simple keyword searches. It’s a powerful learning tool, offering diverse ideas, concepts, and perspectives from articles, videos, books, and more. Google acts as a portal to global knowledge, with answers to almost everything. When working on projects, I rely on Google to quickly gather information on topics like cooking challenges, kitchen equipment, and user preferences, helping me explore ideas and deepen my understanding.
#### Problem Solving Skill 
Problem solving skill is the core of engineering design process. This skill helps us think of new and creavie ways to solve problems. For example, when it comes to cooking, we need to understand challenges people face: like not having enough time, struggling with certain tasks, or having problem with kitchen tools or equipment. Once we know the issues, we can come up the solution faster.
