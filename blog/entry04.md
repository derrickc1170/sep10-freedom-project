<h1>Topic Aframe</h1>

## Context
In this Entry, I am using a tool for a website in Sep 10 which it is Aframe.A-Frame is a powerful web framework used to create 3D and VR experiences directly in the browser. A-Frame makes it easy to build interactive 3D models using simple HTML-like syntax.I've been tinkering with A-Frame to build my own 3D model. Through experimentation and following guides, I’m learning how to use A-Frame’s entity-component system to design web experiences.While using Aframe, I experince lot of problem using aframe which led my model to glitching out or code not working.Even though these error cause lot time to fix, I have lot of fun using Aframe.

## Engineering Design Process
I’m currently inalizing the code for my robot model to integrate it into my website as part of my engineering design process. 

## Skill 
#### Googling 
Google saves time by providing quick access to information through simple searches. It’s a valuable learning tool, offering diverse insights from articles, videos, and more. I rely on Google to gather information on topics like cooking challenges and kitchen tools, helping me explore ideas and expand my knowledge.
#### Problem Solving Skill 
Problem-solving skills are key in engineering design, allowing us to find creative solutions. For example, in cooking, understanding challenges like time constraints or equipment issues helps us quickly develop effective solutions.
