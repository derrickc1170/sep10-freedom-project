<h1>Topic Aframe</h1>
In this Entry, I am using a tool for a website in Sep 10 which it is Aframe.A-Frame is a powerful web framework used to create 3D and VR experiences directly in the browser. A-Frame makes it easy to build interactive 3D models using simple HTML-like syntax.

## Context
I've been tinkering with A-Frame to build my own 3D model. Through experimentation and following guides, I’m learning how to use A-Frame’s entity-component system to design immersive web experiences.

## Engineering Design Process
I’m currently finalizing all the content for the website as part of my engineering design process. This involves refining text, optimizing images, and ensuring a user-friendly layout to enhance the overall user experience and functionality.

## Skill 
#### Googling 
Googling saves time by providing instant access to information through simple keyword searches. It’s a powerful learning tool, offering diverse ideas, concepts, and perspectives from articles, videos, books, and more. Google acts as a portal to global knowledge, with answers to almost everything. When working on projects, I rely on Google to quickly gather information on topics like cooking challenges, kitchen equipment, and user preferences, helping me explore ideas and deepen my understanding.
#### Problem Solving Skill 
Problem solving skill is the core of engineering design process. This skill helps us think of new and creavie ways to solve problems. For example, when it comes to cooking, we need to understand challenges people face: like not having enough time, struggling with certain tasks, or having problem with kitchen tools or equipment. Once we know the issues, we can come up the solution faster.
