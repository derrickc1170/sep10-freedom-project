### Context
Today I am presenting what I have learn about after I present my freedom project of my Class and Expo and also takeaway that I lrean .

### Class Presention
<p>During the presentation, I presented my Freedom Project website in front of my classmates. My website focused on cooking and introduced four helpful inventions. I explained how these inventions benefit cooking easier and more efficient. Shared some challenges I faced while making the site, such as trying to align an accordion on the right side with an image on the left in the wireframe.</p>

<p>My takeaway was that I noticed was that I didn’t make a lot of eye contact while I was presenting. I was mostly looked at the screen or away from the class. It made it harder for people to stay interested in what I was saying. Next time, I should work on looking at my audience more so they can see I’m confident and actually care about what I made.</p>

<p>Another thing I learned is that my slides weren’t that good. I have rushed them, so the slide didn’t make much sense and didn’t look very nice. Next time, I’ll try to plan them better , so they match what I am showing to my audience.
</p>


### Expo Presention
<p>At the Expo, I was really nervous. I got to school around 7:50 AM and felt super anxious before everything started. I was number 40 on the list, so I had to wait a while before I could present. When it was finally my turn to talk to the four judges, I tried to explain my project as best as I could.</p>

<p>My project was a cooking website that included four inventions that could make cooking easier. But while I was talking, I forgot a few lines that I had planned to say. I also didn’t explain what tools I used to make my website, especially when one of the judges asked. That made me feel unprepared.</p>

<p> My takeaway during this time is that I learned that it's really important to practice more before a big presentation like this. I also learned that if I get nervous, I need to try and stay calm so I can focus on what I want to say.



### EDP
I’ve completed my website as part of the engineering design process, finalizing the content, optimizing images, and creating a user-friendly layout to enhance both functionality and user experience.
