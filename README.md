# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Derrick Chen**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

The Freedom Project is project where we make a website with any idea we want to make it into reality.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Cooking**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **Cooking** in order to help me make my website.



This project explores innovative food technologies that have the potential to revolutionize how we cook, eat, and sustain ourselves in a rapidly changing world. Featuring tools like the Printer Cooking Station, Digital Item Website, Need Cut, and Recombinator, these inventions aim to tackle real-world challenges such as food waste, accessibility, and sustainability—paving the way for a smarter, more inclusive food future.

Content:
The blog focuses on four original technological concepts:

* Printer Cooking Station: A 3D-printing-inspired kitchen appliance that can assemble meals layer by layer from customizable ingredients, reducing waste and expanding meal personalization.

* Digital Item Website: An online platform where users can browse, customize, and download any item.

* Need Cut: A precision-cutting tool that uses AI to portion ingredients exactly according to nutritional or aesthetic needs, enhancing both health and presentation.

* Recombinator: A molecular gastronomy device that rearranges food elements to create new textures, flavors, or forms—making meals more exciting and accessible, especially for those with dietary restrictions.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Global/Economic: Supports global food equity by offering scalable, customizable food solutions that can serve diverse populations and reduce hunger.

* Environmental: Significantly cuts food waste and emissions by using precise ingredients and sustainable inputs.

* Social/Cultural: Encourages culinary creativity and inclusivity, accommodating cultural preferences and dietary needs.

* Individual: Enhances daily life by simplifying meal prep, improving nutrition, and making food more enjoyable.

##### CONS
* Economic/Jobs: May disrupt traditional cooking and farming industries, affecting employment in low-tech sectors.

* Cultural: Risk of diminishing traditional food cultures as meals become more tech-driven and less handcrafted.

* Governments/Laws: Raises questions about regulation of lab-designed meals and food safety standards for tech-produced food.

* Infrastructure: Demands investment in tech infrastructure and education to ensure broad access and usability.
